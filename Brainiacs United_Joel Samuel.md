# Smoke-Free Horizon: Leveraging Innovation to overcome Cigarette Addiction
## Problem Overview:
"Every breath taken, every life lost" `Nicotine addiction` claims millions of lives worldwide, enslaving individuals in a vicious cycle of craving and relapse. Despite the Dangers the struggle to quit is real:
* **70% of smokers** unable to overcome the grip of nicotine.
* **The absence of real-time monitoring** and personalized support hinders the journey to a smoke-free life.
### Healthcare Burden
Smoking causes people to have many chronic illness such **<u>Lung cancer</u>**,**<u> Heart disease</u>** and  <u>**chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</u>**.
Smoking kills ariund 8 million people each year, with an estimated 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to `second-hand smoke`.
### Social and Family Issues
Second-hand smoke exposure affects non-smokers, especially children, while smoking-related illnesses strain family relationships.
### Economic Consequences
Smoking results in significant economic losses due to productivity decline, absenteeism, and healthcare expenses.
### Addiction and Mental Health
Nicotine addiction perpetuates a cycle of dependence, linked to increased risk of mental health issues.

#### The absence of effective solutions leaves individuals trapped in a haze of addiction. It's time for innovation to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and create a smoke-free future.
## Solution Overview:
1. Briefly describe your proposed solution.
2. Highlight the key features and benefits.
## How It Works:
### Wearable, Battery-Free Nicotine Sensor Can Monitor Your Exposure to Smoke and Vape Mist
Our innovative sensor harnesses the power of near-field communication (NFC) to track nicotine exposure in real-time, without the need for batteries. This compact, wearable device uses cutting-edge technology to help individuals to monitor their nicotine levels with very little difficulty.

**Components:**

1. **Vanadium Dioxide (VO₂) Sensor:** A highly sensitive material that reacts to nicotine, altering its electrical characteristics.
2. **Amplifier:** Boosts the sensor's signal, ensuring accurate and reliable detection.
3. **NFC Chip:** Wirelessly transmits data to a smartphone or NFC-capable device, enabling seamless monitoring.

__Technical Advantages:__

- **Battery-Free:** Eliminates the need for battery replacement or recharging.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides instantaneous updates on nicotine exposure.
- **Compact Design:** Wearable device for unobtrusive monitoring.
- **High Sensitivity:** Accurately detects nicotine levels, even in small concentrations.

__Technical Specifications:__

- **Sensor Material:** Vanadium Dioxide (VO₂)
- **Sensitivity:** upto 5 meters.
- **Power Consumption:** Zero (battery-free)

>nicotine can bond covalently to a thin film of VO2. Hence, depending on the nicotine concentration the conductivity of the film changes. The device detects the change in conductivity, amplifies the signal and then transmits it wirelessly to a smartphone.

* Portable nicotine sensors are being developed as an alternative, but the two that have been reported are impractical because they rely either on the presence of sweat or sunlight to function.
* To effectively reach potential users, it is important that we understand specific needs and behaviours of various segments:
-**Smokers seeking cessation:** At the front are the frequent smokers themselves who are actively trying to quit. A nicotine sensor can serve as a critical tool in their journey, providing real-time feedback and tracking progress.
-**Healthcare Professionals:** Doctors and cessation specialists can make use of the data from nicotine sensors to adjust and make effective smoking cessation programs for their patients. The data from the sensor helps healthcare professionals in understanding the patterns and triggers of nicotine cravings, so they can offer more personalized support when appropriate.
-**Parents/Guardians:** Parents/Guardians concerned about adolescent smoking, can use nicotine sensors as a preventive measure to ensure their children are not exposed to nicotine.
-**Public Health Agencies** Data from widespread use of nicotine sensors can inform public health agencies to enforce appropriate public health policies and regulations.
* In consideration of these perspectives, manufacturing and marketing the sensor will not only ensure its advancement in technology but also its compliance with societal health and well being.
## Potential Impact:
* Describe the expected positive outcomes of implementing your idea.
* Consider social, environmental, or economic impacts.
